# Calculator Sample

This sample code implements a simple iOS calculator app with a 
small amount of _shared_ common code built with KMM.  In this
first pass there is no Android application as the sample is 
intended to be a test-bed for a number of learning goals around
iOS development concepts and how KMM code presents itself across
the Kotlin to Swift interface.
